*October 27, 1993. Survived: 3 months, 20 days. Kills: 1,868.*

Life is quiet, here at the farm in the woods. "Farm" here means
a converted soccer field at the youth scout camp that I've taken over.
I grow vegetables there now.

There are a couple bodies of water nearby; there's a lake in the woods, and a big river nearby. Both are great spots to fish.

Sometimes I have to go into the nearest town.
West Point is an infested hellhole; just driving past it was
initially challenging. I resorted to fire.

Fire is dangerous. It can spread unchecked and wipe out entire towns.
Zombies take hours to die from the burns, during which time they
shuffle around and spread it even more. And then when you come back
weeks later, the fire is still going, and ... this.

I started in Muldraugh. Survival was a
struggle for a while, and I nearly lost the run a couple times trying
to grab essentials in dodgy cars that broke down at precisely the wrong
time. I was badly injured for a bit and spent almost a month of
summer convalescing.

Around the beginning of October I relocated north, towards Louisville. 
I'm not allowing myself to use the
[godmode map site](https://map.projectzomboid.com/). I scouted ahead in
a small car, looking for a small, quiet spot to farm. That's when I
stumbled on this camp and its creepy buildings full of empty desks and
abandoned backpacks.

The goal of this playthrough is to check out some of the new, modded
locations: Raven's Creek and Fort Redstone. These areas are supposedly
very dangerous, so my plan is to spend the winter training up
for spring expeditions.

Because I have long-term goals for this playthrough, it's extra
important to not lose the run due to something dumb. I've turned
off infection, so that means I can't die due to the zombie virus.
I also boosted the XP gain by four. My reasoning is that I refuse
to invest time in repetitive grinds without some guarantee.

I've also allowed myself a couple cheats to reduce annoyance.
Specifically, I've been deleting trees growing in the very long dirt
road to the camp. Otherwise, trees grow absurdly fast, with saplings
sprouting up every couple of weeks. I even tried cheating and adding
pavement, but the trees don't stop. They. Never. Stop.

Winter is starting, and so I have two new enemies. First is my
character's obscene appetite. Growing vegetables
during the winter is difficult, as well as catching fish and rabbits.
I have three freezers full of produce and meat, but it's likely some
of that will spoil before the end of winter.

The other serious threat is boredom. Life is a very limited routine
right now: cook meals, check crops, exercise, maybe grind a skill.
With the temperatures dropping below freezing, it's getting harder
to keep entertained. This is two-fold: in-game my character gets
bored indoors, but being outside runs the risk of catching a cold.
And as my IRL patience for passing through three months of this wanes,
it's increasingly likely that I'll do something risky that could end
the whole run.
