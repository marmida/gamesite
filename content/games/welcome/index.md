I'm starting a little blog to share my gaming misadventures with y'all.
Why a blog, especially in this day and age? First, I'm done with social
media; I'll figure out how to push updates to interested parties.
Second, I don't want to obligate myself to record and edit videos for
every post; that's a new job that I don't need. Third, because this is
relatively low investment; if it doesn't fit, we'll re-assess later.
