*November 7, 1993. Survived 4 months, 1 day. Killed 2,192.*

Because the in-game date was approaching one of IRL significance, I
decided it was time to bake a cake. Cakes are finicky because they
require a lot of tools and ingredients. Worse, some of those
ingredients are perishable, so once the power goes out, the majority
of them spoil.

The two usual barriers to cake-baking are milk and eggs. Both are
perishable, and I only have eggs. I've got one can of evaporated
milk handy, which the window above says is a workable substitute.
So, all good, right?

**First Trip**

The button in the crafting UI won't light up, so I'm missing
something, but the game won't say what. Pie is also an option -
it requires fewer ingredients - and that button lights up.
So, let's try a pie.

I don't have a baking pan, and in Zomboid, each piece of cookware is
strictly required for each recipe. You can't use a roasting pan for
a stir fry - preposterous! Let's go hit up a local neighborhood and
see if we can't find this important bit of kitchen kit.

As soon as I start down the very long driveway out from the scout camp,
I realize that the zombos have migrated in.

Migration in Zomboid causes large packs to coalesce and move together.
Tens and tens more came out of the trees, every time I honked my horn.
My base isn't heavily fortified; my main defense is the quiet, remote
location. In order to keep things that way, all these zombies need to
die.

A hundred or so corpses later, I return home very tired. Maybe tomorrow?

The next day, I get up and out early and head towards a very remote 
residential neighborhood. I slowly work my way from house to house, until I finally find it!

{{< imgfig "Project Zomboid 4_17_2023 12_53_23 AM.png" "Victory!" >}}

I return home to the pie dough sitting patiently in the fridge and
think to myself, is this really what I want? Am I really going to
settle for a pie when I have all these hard-earned eggs in the
freezer? I've fought hard to get the extra gasoline to power a
generator to supply multiple freezers to keep these eggs cold for the
four months since the start of the game. Am I really going to give up
now?

**Second Trip**

The scout camp is close-ish to one of the two malls in the game. Malls
are infested deathtraps, to be sure. But, maybe I don't need to go
into the mall itself, and instead can go to one of the big
restaurants next door? I remember a Pile o' Crepe (IHOP) in the same
parking lot; maybe I can distract the crowd in the parking lot, sneak 
in, and get out?

{{< ytfig id="Hp8izx5QvyU" caption="Poor plan, poor execution, 11/10" >}}

The parking lot is a mess, and my arrival only makes it messier. I
spot two potential targets: Pile o' Crepe and Churns 'R Us. I try
honking to draw the crowds away, but there's just. SO. MANY.

I do a quick side quest to grab some books from a neighboring strip
mall and return to try the main parking lot again. The honking was a
mistake. And I then compound that mistake with the overconfidence of
a bag full of firearms. Every shotgun blast calls every zombie within
about 100 meters; there are easily 500 zombies in the area.

I loop out west of the parking lot into a field and switch to my long
range rifle. Maybe I can whittle down the crowd from range? Surprising
absolutely no one, there are too many, and I circle around the movie
theater back into the center of the parking lot. I'm getting out of
here.

It'd be great to clear this area out, but I'll need literal fire to
do so. And something to attract the crowd - probably an emergency
vehicle's siren? Something for the next visit.

**Interlude: Rainy Day Walk**

It rained and I needed a downtime activity. Why not collect some
fresh berries for our eventual cake? Foraging in the forest usually
provides, so let's go for a little stroll with an umbrella.

I got a late start, around noon, and the rain stopped around 6 PM.
I finally found my berries close to dusk. I had gone off-trail deep
into the woods, and so it was going to be a long walk through damp
trees to get home. I set out in the general direction of home, when...
is that a helicopter?

{{< ytfig id="NI6sG9Kzj4A" caption="Gunshots in the dark" >}}

Late-game helicopters are always hostile. The story is that
in the early days of the outbreak, news, the police, and samaritans
will fly by and do nice things (albeit drawing swarms of zombies).
But this late into the outbreak, the only survivors are the military
and raiders. They shoot everything on sight.

I thought I might be able to stay hidden for a second under the cover
of the trees, but the helicopter closed in, anyway. There's nothing
left to do but run. I jogged west, crashing through trees, tearing
holes in my clothes. Then the shots started. I could hear the impact
of the bullets nearby; the shots were aiming for me. I kept moving,
doing my best not to get stuck on trees in the dim light. Another
near miss. Just after I crossed a trail, the helicopter broke off.
I was alone again.

These berries better be tasty.

**Third Trip**

Given that I was able to make pie dough, but not cake batter, I
must be shy on one of the ingredients. And since I only have one can
of evaporated milk, I suspect that's what we need. Via similar process
of elimination, I deduce that we've got one obvious source: West
Point.

West Point sucks. You can read about it in a 
[past episode](/games/pz-2023-04-14/). Our best bet is to stay
sneaky, avoid firearms, and move fast.

I refuel the car and get an early start down the very long backroads
heading to West Point. I'm not sure on exactly which stores to hit,
but I know there's a main street that has a lot of businesses with
commercial kitchens, and one of them has to do baked goods.

On the outskirts of town, I'm greeted with a sight of suburban bliss:

{{< imgfig "Project Zomboid 4_17_2023 3_24_19 PM.png" "Welcome to GigaMart, I love you" >}}

{{< imgfig "Project Zomboid 4_17_2023 3_24_57 PM.png" "God bless American consumerism" >}}

Surprisingly, the parking lot is not swamped. I park the car,
clear out the interior, locate the rear exits, and look back at
the parking lot. It's ... clear?

Because GigaMart is CostCo, there is a cafe. And baking pans. And
evaporated milk. And carloads of other stuff. I fill my
Chevalier Carnifex (Chevy Suburban) and head home, ashamed at how
easy and obvious that was.

**All's Well That Ends In Cake**

After hauling in my loot, I start the process of deducing which
ingredient I neeeded. I open a new can of evaporated milk. No luck.
I put raw eggs in the oven to make extra sure they're not frozen.
Still no luck. I put all the ingredients on my person to make sure
I have everything handy. Nothing.

One of the ingredients is sugar packets. I have four in my inventory.
On a hunch, I dig out a whole bag of sugar.

{{< imgfig "Project Zomboid 4_17_2023 7_16_54 PM.png" "Let there be cake!" >}}

{{< imgfig "Project Zomboid 4_17_2023 7_17_36 PM.png" "Hyper-realistic cake consumpiton" >}}

Sweet success! Let's ignore the fact that, apart from the baking pan,
I had all the ingredients all along.

This one goes out to a special someone. I hope we get to have fun,
exploring the virtual apocalypse together, soon.

*Errata: if you look closely at the dates and times of the screenshots
and videos, you'll note that the order of events doesn't exactly match
the retelling above. Honestly, I can't recall the specifics, and I like
this version of the story better anyway.*
