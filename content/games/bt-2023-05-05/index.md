*Orca 2. Aphotic Plateau. Balance: 16,800 Marks.*

Barotrauma is a series of maps, each of which may have
one or more objectives on it. The start and end of each map
may have a station to dock at. The maps themselves are
procedurally generated; they inherit certain characteristics
from their biome, but are unique to the playthrough.

Biomes tweak a lot of settings for map generation. The
style of caves, the monster spawns, the mineral deposits,
even the background art.

We have completed the journey from the second biome, the 
Europan Ridge, into the third, the Aphotic Plateau. I'm
imagining a travel brochure selling the destination as follows.

**Husk-Infested Beacon Stations**

{{< video src="Barotrauma 2023-05-02 22-41-58.mp4" caption="Come for the free hugs, stay for the love bites!" >}}

The beacon stations are much more likely to have former
human inhabitants wanting to infect you with their parasitic
bites.

Don't forget to carry anti-parasite drugs!

**Ever-Present Thresher Swarms**

{{< video src="Barotrauma 2023-05-02 22-13-14.mp4" caption="I don't care if the explosions damage our own hull" >}}

Tiger Threshers are long shark bois that want to get into your
ship. Bone Threshers help them achieve this, by being much
bigger and better at punching holes in your hull. Both like
to pop up all over the place in the Aphotic Plateau.

**Fun and Exciting Wrecks to Salvage**

{{< ytfig id="8FKt2N55SfA" caption="They're in the floor!" >}}

Sometimes somebody pays you to get a McGuffin from a wrecked
submarine. Sometimes that sub is full of husks, and sometimes,
it's full of carnivorous armored sea lions called 
*mudraptors*. Every time, it's creepy.

**New Friends!**

{{< video src="Barotrauma 2023-05-03 10-35-47.mp4" caption="Can I have your diving suit please" >}}

Sometimes the easiest way to take a diving suit involves 
bringing along its former owner.

**Spineling Showers**

{{< video src="Barotrauma 2023-05-04 08-48-45.mp4" caption="Please keep your vomiting down" >}}

Huge swarms of monsters means a peaceful aftermath full
of sinking corpses, punctuated by crewmembers with bad
concussions vomiting all over the sub.

**Submarine Spa Day**

{{< video src="Barotrauma 2023-05-04 12-04-49.mp4" caption="Get the 'me' time you deserve" >}}

Because eventually all the blood and vomit makes it hard
to see.

**Ghost Ship Tours**

{{< ytfig id="AEEl7M-sHo4" caption="Wrecks love company" >}}

I got ambushed by a *thalamus*, a semi-intelligent organism
that takes over submarines and uses them to consume more
submarines. The captain nearly died, trapped in a compartment 
full of water, until the roof conveniently collapsed, allowing 
escape.

Realizing what we were up against, I used the explosive ammo
in the bottom gun to scour the aggressor clean. A boarding 
party went in to investigate but found nothing alive.

Thankfully.

**Indiana Jones Moments!**

Aliens inhabited Europa a minute ago, but mysteriously left,
because of course. And so now humans pay other, stupider
humans money to go into these ruins and fetch things. And that
stupid human is me.

{{< ytfig id="xS9o_U0SkaY" caption="We are bad at this" >}}

Here we see multiple near-death moments, including:

* several encounters with the *fractal guardians*, which are 
the biomechanical servants of alien origin
* poor choice of weaponry in my bringing a two-handed grenade
launcher to what became a series of close-quarters scuffles
* a near-bite encounter with a husked human, saved by my
comrade's shotgun
* near-death flailing under a barrage of *swarm feeders*,
realizing that I was out of ammo, and my AI companion was
very stupid
* another husked human ambush that ended in a bite and an
infection

"My throat feels sore," says Azul Blakley, my backup. That's
a sure sign of husk infection. I check our collective pockets,
but neither of us have anything to stop or slow the parasite.

We were deep in the ruins and needed to get back fast. I used
a tool to cut through layers of walls, heading directly for open water.

"There's s--- moving in my thr---." Azul is rendered mute by 
the parasite growing in the back of her mouth. We're running
out of time before the seizures and death.

After cutting through three walls, I see open ocean. I send 
Azul back to the sub, where the doctor immediately injects
her with the anti-parasiting drug calyxanide, saving her.

**Megafauna Safari**

{{< imgfig "Barotrauma 5_4_2023 3_33_50 PM.png" "Not lipstick" >}}

This is a charybdis. It is dead. It is very large, and is almost as big as the submarine.

Let's see how we got here.

{{< ytfig id="b7XhqNnN-vY" caption="Orca 2 cancels mining: interrupted by Charybdis" >}}

I took a contract to gather some resources from *the abyss*,
the region at the bottom of the map with two main dangers.
First, there are gigantic monsters actively patrolling, ready
to smash your sub. Second, being at increased depths exposes
you to higher pressures.

My strategy was simple: sneak in, get the resources, get out.
I would turn off the reactor and use a sonar decoy to get
away at the first sign of trouble. I'll keep the sub moving 
slowly and quietly, using passive sonar if possible.

Just as I sidle up next to my target, the sonar scope shows 
orange waves of echolocation. A ping. A roar. From a monster.

I drop the sonar decoy, turn on the batteries, and run.
Another ping. And another, closer. The thing is closing in on
us, and it looks like our subterfuge is foiled.

The ship is near an island, a projection of rock. The captain
perches the ship on top of it, in the hopes it'll protect us
from uncontrolled sinking.

The monster strikes. All crew go to guns or fixing leaks.
The first blow nudges the ship, but the repairs keep it from
sinking, and the autopilot returns us to the top of the 
island. The next blow blasts the ship off the island and rips 
a huge hole, causing the sub to sink past the island.

Fortunately, there is a bottom here! Without this, we would 
have sunk past crush depth and all have been squished. We're
on the sea floor alongside some volcanic vents, using the top
guns to slowly whittle down the beast.

The charybdis rams us to the right until we're stuck in a 
little cave. The crew switches to our best, most expensive 
ammo. We're down to using just one gun, our weakest, to
slowly plink away at its health.

It's an awkward fight. It's slow and painful. The sub is
flooded and the crews are not able to keep up with the damage.
Fortunately for us, we have lots of welding fuel to keep
repairing. Unfortunately for the monster, it doesn't heal.

Eventually, it dies. We take a close-up look at the corpse; 
its mouth is bigger than a person.

We gather the contracted minerals and leave.

{{< sectionbreak >}}

We are quite well-financed now. We have plenty of resources 
for fabricating weapons and ammunition. The submarine's 
systems have all been upgraded several times. We even have
some fancy alien guns that we haven't played with yet.

Our main objective now is getting a new submarine. At some 
point soon, we will need bigger guns to keep the monsters
out, and the ocean with them. The Orca 2 doesn't have much
firepower, and our biggest gun is on the bottom, where it's
useless once the ship is flooded and resting on the sea floor.

Onward, comrades. Maybe we'll find what we're looking for in
the next biome.
