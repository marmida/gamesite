For the uninitiated, *Oxygen Not Included* is a colony builder
with the titular catch: you don't get to breathe for free. A
bunch of very helpless colonists are printed by a machine inside
the depths of an asteroid.

You get to manage lots of fun things,
like making breathable air, water, food, and heat rejection. That
last bit is way more important than it sounds - this game is more
like *Entropy Simulator* and yeah of course it has Touring-complete
programming for automation.

Here's the plumbing overlay showing our first flushing toilets, established on cycle (day) 5:

The starting biome is the only one with pre-existing pockets of clean
water. We want to consolidate those into our main drinking water
supply tank. But because we want that water to stay clean, we also
build a protective shell around it, so spills of contiminants and/or
piss don't get consumed. Hence, we have to do a little minor
relocation every time we want to consolidate puddles; here's the first
such effort.

This is my fourth or fifth playthrough after a couple hundred hours,
so here's the rules:

1. no speedrunning, wiki study, spreadsheets, or nerdy video guide consultation
2. graves are fun; no backtracking unless it's absolutely necessary
3. When in doubt, seek guidance from Acid King: *drive fast, take chances*

And some goals:

1. build a steam power generator. I usually skip this because it causes
   lots of scalded duplicants, but this time, let's gooooo
2. visit other asteroids via spaaaaace
3. support more than 25 dups. I usually keep a tiny crew to minimize
   resource consumption, so let's do the opposite.
4. don't sweat the small stuff
5. if a project takes too long, scale it down
