*Orca 2. Europan Ridge. Balance: 382 Marks.*

Barotrauma is a conundrum. On one hand, it's a highly inventive and
effective combination of simulation, crafting, and horror. On the
other, it's both an annoying slog, and also, horror.

I don't like horror. It actually works on me. I still remember quitting
Star Control 3 when I was like...13? because the text logs of a surface
expedition creeped me out. There weren't even pictures!

But I do like this game. There's a couple different classes of
experiences; the main type you'll see is defending the sub via
mounted weaponry against gigantic oceanic horrors like this:

This lures you into feeling powerful and protected. Big things can't
get into your sub, so as long as you keep the water out and bouyancy
controlled, you won't succumb to death by crushing pressures.

There's other types of missions, though. Sometimes you have to get
out of the sub. And go into another sub. A wrecked sub. And you find
out why it's wrecked.

This is the part I hate. You can hear the monsters in the sub you're
trying to clear. Your sub's guns will damage the stuff inside the
wreck, reducing the potential salvage value. So, your best bet is to
gingerly peel open the sub, keeping your backside covered while you
clear it out, room by room.

Because that's not horrible enough, there's a class of enemy called
a *husk* that's the game's zombie archetype. There's a parasite that
spreads between native fauna and humans; it takes over bodies, grows
tentacles, gains a bunch of superpowers, and tries to bite.

{{< imgfig "Barotrauma 4_4_2023 10_55_14 PM.png" "That was a human once" >}}

The human variants are bullet sponges, immune to pressure and 
capable of tanking lots of shots, but otherwise just an annoying
disease vector. The cure is handy, if expensive, so at least it's not
Project Zomboid.

The non-human variants are just gross. Some mods make the
[submarine-sized megafauna husked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsDNb9uYpG8), so yeah, good times.

The safer approach is to try to open up the wreck and let your
submarine-mounted guns do the work. But, since I'm playing with bots,
this comes with unique occupational hazards.

Hence the annoyance bit: the game is truly designed for multi-player
mayhem, but also has a single-player campaign tacked on. Because the
game does a good job of requiring multiple characters to split up
tasks, playing it solo is cumbersome and time-consuming. And then you
die.

I shall press on, regardless. At least when there's enough daylight
to keep me from being scared.
